# Python Development Standards

## Code Quality

- Write Pythonic code that adheres to PEP 8 standards
- Use type hints and docstrings for clarity and maintainability
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles
- Use virtual environments or Docker for dependency isolation
- Implement automated tests using pytest
- Use colorama and logging with lazy formatting for output clarity
- Use pyproject.toml as the single source of truth for metadata and tooling

## Code Structure

- Follow PEP8 best practices
- Include docstrings where required
- Avoid inline comments unless necessary
- Prefer colorama and colors in logging
- Use lazy formatting for logging

## Project Organization

- Use virtual environments or Docker for dependency isolation
- Create appropriate requirements.txt or pyproject.toml files
- Follow standard Python project structure
- Include comprehensive testing with pytest

## Development Practices

- Use type hints for better code documentation and IDE support
- Implement proper error handling and exception management
- Use context managers appropriately
- Apply pythonic patterns and idioms
- Prefer built-in functions and libraries over custom implementations

## Testing Standards

- Implement automated tests using pytest
- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Use proper test fixtures and mocking
- Maintain good test coverage
